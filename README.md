Build a simple supermarket checkout app using object oriented design principle and test driven development.

### To achieve these goals:
- "I know how my language works"
- "I can build with objects"
- "I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan

Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of a number of items.

Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

### The requirements for the system are as follows:

##### As a shopper:

- *So I know how much an item costs...* I would like to be able to see its price
- *So that I can buy an item...* I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout
- *So that I know how much to pay...* I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items
- *So that I know how much to pay...* I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (Â£xx.xx)
